## Requirements

### Packet-forwarder

LoRa Channel Manager is an addition to the [packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder)
process. Before installing the LoRa Channel Manager utility, make sure your
packet-forwarder is up-and-running. Ideally you already have tested that your
gateway works correctly with the LoRa Server project using the standard
configuration supplied with your gateway.
